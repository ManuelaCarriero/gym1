# What is the aim of this repository ? 
This repo just stores all the little exercizes that I did to learn Python programming and how to use Git and Github. <br />
<br />
This is if you want to add an image without resizing it:
<br />
`![Autumn Landscape Image](https://github.com/ManuelaCarriero/gym/blob/main/Images/Dreaming.jpg)`
<br />
If you want to choose the size:
<br />
`<img src="https://github.com/ManuelaCarriero/gym/blob/main/Images/Dreaming.jpg" width="500">`
<br />
This is our sweet image:
<br />
<img src="https://github.com/ManuelaCarriero/gym/blob/main/Images/Dreaming.jpg" width="500">
<br />
With the gif animated images, it is the same code line: 
<br />
<img src="https://github.com/ManuelaCarriero/gym/blob/main/Images/Autumn.gif" width="500">
<br />
Hoping to have a nice journey through this "pythonic" world, <br />
*Cheers!* <br />
Manuela
